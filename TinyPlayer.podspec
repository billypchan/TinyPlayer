  s.description      = <<-DESC
Served as the core player component of our Quazer[] app, we spent a lot of effort to build it up by
following the industrial best practises in terms of maximal utilizing Apple’s AVFoundation framework.
AVFoundation is powerful but unfortunately not easy to use. To unleash the most potential of it, an
experienced developer will also spend quiet amount of time to set up everything correctly.
We alleviate the burden of you by providing a easy-to-use player component which encapsulates all
the complexities within.
